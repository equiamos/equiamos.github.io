  <img src="../img/pics/IMG_1602.jpg" ALT="Morning Glory Pool">

  <p>Yellowstone National Park is an incredible place, and I firmly advocate
  exploring every nook and cranny of the park. It definitely catches a lot
  of flac on account of the hordes of tourists that visit the park during
  the peak summer season, but it is not over-rated. It's the wilderness
  equivalent of disney, complete with spectacular shows, both scheduled
  (Old Faithful Geyser) and impromptu (most every other geyser).</p>

  <ul>
    <h4>Geothermal Features:</h4>
    <li>Morning Glory Pool</li>
    <li>Gran Prismatic Spring</li>
    <li>Old Faithful</li>
    <li>Dragon's Mouth Spring</li>

    <h4>Sights:</h4>
      <li>Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone</li>
      <li>Roosevelt Arch</li>
      <h5>Located at the northeast entrace of Yellowstone National Park, along
        with some good nearby dinner eateries for after you've captures the shot
        of the arch after spending the whole day in the park and are looking
        for some good, healthy and filling dinner choices.</h5>

    <h4>Wildlife Viewing:</h4>
      <li>Hayden Valley</li>
      <li>Lamar Valley</li>

      <h4>Wildlife to see:</h4>
      <p>Some wildlife are rarer than others, but all are present
      within the park. Most often determiniation and patience pay off
      and you will likely manage to see what you came to see if you
      look long and hard enough.</p>
      <p>Talk to your park rangers, as they are the most in the know when
        it comes to the locations of the animals within the park. Visit the ___
        visitors center and talk to the rangers stationed there. Ones stationed
        by the entrance gates often do not have access to this information
        and are tasked with keeping track of camping spot availiability at the
        various campgrounds.</p>
