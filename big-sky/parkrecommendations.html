  <p>Yellowstone National Park is an incredible place, and I firmly advocate
  exploring every nook and cranny of the park. It definitely catches a lot
  of flac on account of the hordes of tourists that visit the park during
  the peak summer season, but it is not over-rated. It's the wilderness
  equivalent of Disneyland, complete with spectacular shows, both scheduled
  (Old Faithful Geyser) and impromptu (most every other geyser).</p>

  <ul>
    <h4>Geothermal Features:</h4>
    <li>Grand Prismatic Spring</li>
    <li>Old Faithful</li>
    <li>Dragon's Mouth Spring</li>
    <li>Morning Glory Pool</li>

    <h4>Sights:</h4>
      <li>Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone</li>
      <li>Roosevelt Arch</li>
      <h6><p>Located at the northeast entrace of Yellowstone National Park, along
        with a good nearby hole-in-the-wall restaurant.</p></h6>

    <h4>Wildlife Viewing:</h4>
      <li>Hayden Valley</li>
      <li>Lamar Valley</li>

      <h4>Wildlife to see:</h4>
      <p>Some wildlife are rarer than others, but all are present
      within the park. Usually determination and patience pay off
      and you will likely manage to see what you came to see if you
      look long and hard enough.</p>
      <p>Talk to your park rangers, as they are the most in the know when
        it comes to the locations of the animals within the park. Visit the
        visitor's center and talk to the rangers stationed there. Ones stationed
        by the entrance gates often do not have access to this information
        and are tasked with keeping track of camping spot availiability at the
        various campgrounds.</p>

      <li>Bison</li>
      <li>Black Bear</li>
      <li>Grizzly Bear</li>
      <li>Elk</li>
      <li>Mule-tailed Deer</li>
      <li>White-tailed Deer</li>
      <li>Moose</li>
      <li>Wolves</li>

    <h4>Hikes:</h4>

    <h4>Camping:</h4>
    <p>I highly recommend camping outside of the park. Rangers at the visitor's
      center and park campgrounds will have a printed list of the nearby national
      forest campgrounds and their proximity from each park exit. These campgrounds
      are much less crowded than the ones in the park and considerably less expensive.
      Space is at a premium within the park, so if you camp there expect to be
      in very close proximity to your neighbors. Campsites outside of the park
      are much more spacious and scenic.</p>
      <li>Crazy Creek Campground</li>
      <h6><p>This is one of my all-time personal favorites. Make sure to choose a spot with
      a view of the creek (most people don't and many come and go never even
      aware of its existance). In warmer months there's a waterfall across the
      street.</p></h6>
      <li></li>
