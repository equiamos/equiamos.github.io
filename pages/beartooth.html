    <p>Obviously, interests differ, and the nature and goals of your trip will
      dictate the applicability of my suggestions. For instance, although I've
      visited quite a number of cities during the course of my travels, overall
      I've spent relatively little time in them, favoring national parks and
      scenic roads. My trips were geared toward the adventurous 20-something on a
      shoe-string budget attempting to satiate severe wanderlust. Nearly every night was spent camping or sleeping in the car,
      so accommodations were never a concern. I'll do my best to specify
      considerations that come to mind for individual suggestions.</p>
