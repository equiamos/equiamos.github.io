  <p>Thought I would share some firsthand knowledge from my time On The Road</p>

  <p>Some of my personal all time favorites:

    </ul>

  <p>Articles about roadtripping in America frequently popup in my newsfeed, and
    most include itinerary suggestions. Over the past few years I've spent nearly
    a year on the road, over the course of many cross-country trips, spanning a
    cumulative total of over 50,000 miles. This, in addition to extensive research,
    makes me feel qualified to add my personal recommendations, and confident that
    they are among the best of the best.</p>

    <p>Obviously, interests differ, and the nature and goals of your trip will
      dictate the applicability of my suggestions. For instance, although I've
      visited quite a number of cities during the course of my travels, overall
      I've spent relatively little time in them, favoring national parks and
      scenic roads. My trips were geared toward the adventurous 20-something on a
      shoe-string budget attempting to satiate severe wanderlust. We logged a
      lot of miles. Nearly every night was spent camping or sleeping in the car,
      so accommodations were never a concern. I'll do my best to specify
      considerations that come to mind for individual suggestions.</p>
