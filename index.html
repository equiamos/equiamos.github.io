  </a>The Great American Roadtrip</h3>

  <p>I'm a big fan of roadtrips. Over the past few years I've spent nearly a year
    on the road, over the course of many cross-country trips, spanning a
  cumulative total of over 50,000 miles. Thought I would take this opportunity to
  share some recommendations from my time On The Road.</p>

      <span class="octicon octicon-link"></a>Inspiration for Recommendations</h3>
  <p>Articles about roadtripping in America frequently pop up in my newsfeed, and
    most include itinerary suggestions. WWhile most appear to be well-researched,
    occasionally I find myself reading them while shaking my head in dismay,
    wondering whether or not the authors have any firsthand experience.

      href="#caveat"aria-hidden="true">
      <span class="octicon octicon-link"></a>Caveat</h3>
    <p>Obviously, interests differ, and the nature and goals of your trip will
      dictate the applicability of my suggestions. For instance, although I've
      visited quite a number of cities during the course of my travels, overall
      I've spent relatively little time in them, favoring national parks and
      scenic roads. My trips were geared toward the adventurous 20-something on a
      shoe-string budget attempting to satiate severe wanderlust. We logged a
      lot of miles. Nearly every night was spent camping or sleeping in the car,
      so accommodations were never a concern. I'll do my best to specify
      considerations that come to mind for individual suggestions.</p>
